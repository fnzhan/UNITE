![Teaser](teaser.png)

## Marginal Contrastive Correspondence for Guided Image Generation [CVPR 2022]
Including marginal contrastive learning for building correspondence. Please check models/networks/nceloss.py and models/networks/correspondence.py.

## Preparation
Clone the Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch repository.
```
cd models/networks/
git clone https://github.com/vacancy/Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch
cp -rf Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch/sync_batchnorm .
cd ../../
```

**VGG model** for computing loss. Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fp7DAiXdf0Ay-jANb8f0RHYLTRyjNv4m/view?usp=sharing), move it to `models/`.

For the preparation of datasets, please refer to [CoCosNet](https://github.com/microsoft/CoCosNet).

## Pretrained Models
The pretrained models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8B3fdU_suB8dJswR-QPwh-eZfkxSP7F/view?usp=sharing). Saving the pretrained models in `checkpoints`.

## Inference Using Pretrained Model
Then run the command 
````bash
bash test_ade.sh
````

## Training
Then run the command 
````bash
bash train_ade.sh
````

If you want to use marginal contrastive learning for building corresondence, please add --mcl and set the weight --nce_w in train_xxx.sh. Then run:
````bash
bash train_xxx.sh
````
